    Loop Statements allow you to easily repeat a chunk of code many times.

    Example: in a game with a bouncing ball, it would be too much work to type
    out the code to make the ball bounce up and down a thousand times
    (move up, then fall down, move up then fall down, repeat 1000 times).
    Instead you can put the repeated code in a loop

    Loops not only save programmers time, they also make programs shorter.
