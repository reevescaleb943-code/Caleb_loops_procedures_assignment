# Python Starter Template

Welcome! This is your starting point for Python programming projects. Everything is set up and ready to go - you just need to start coding!

## 🚀 Getting Started (Easy Way - Recommended!)

### Using GitHub Codespaces

**This is the easiest way to get started - no installation needed!**

1. Click the green **"Code"** button at the top of this page
2. Click on the **"Codespaces"** tab
3. Click **"Create codespace on main"**
4. Wait about 1-2 minutes while your coding environment sets up
5. You're ready to code! Everything is installed automatically.

**That's it!** Your environment is ready. All the tools you need are already installed.

### What's Installed in Your Codespace?

Your coding environment includes these helpful tools:
- **Python Test Explorer** - See and run your tests with a visual interface (look for the beaker icon 🧪 in the sidebar)
- **Python Debugger** - Step through your code line by line to find bugs
- **Spell Checker** - Helps catch typos in your code and comments
- **Auto-Formatting** - Your code is automatically formatted to look professional when you save (using Black and Prettier)
- **Type Checking** - Alerts you to potential errors before you run your code

All AI assistance (like Copilot) is turned off so you can learn by doing!

## 💻 Running Your First Program

Once your Codespace is ready:

1. Look for the file called `main.py` in the file explorer on the left
2. Click on it to open it
3. In the terminal at the bottom of the screen, type:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Press Enter
5. You should see: `Hello, World!`

**Congratulations!** You just ran your first Python program! 🎉

## ✅ Running Tests

Tests help make sure your code works correctly. You can run tests in two ways:

### Option 1: Using the Terminal (Command Line)

1. In the terminal, type:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
2. Press Enter
3. You should see that 2 tests passed ✓

To see more details about what each test does:
```bash
pytest -v
```

### Option 2: Using the Test Explorer (Visual)

1. Click the beaker/flask icon 🧪 in the left sidebar (Testing)
2. You'll see a list of all your tests
3. Click the ▶️ play button next to a test to run it
4. Green checkmarks ✓ mean the test passed!
5. This is a great way to see which tests pass and which fail

**Tip:** The Test Explorer automatically discovers new tests when you save your files!

## 📁 What's in This Project?

```
python-starter/
├── main.py              # Your main program - start here!
├── tests/               # Tests to check if your code works
│   └── test_main.py     # Example test file
├── requirements.txt     # List of Python tools needed
└── README.md           # This file (instructions)
```

## 📝 How to Start Your Own Project

1. **Open `main.py`** - This is where you'll write your code
2. **Edit the code** - Change the message or add new features
3. **Run it** - Use `python main.py` to see your changes
4. **Test it** - Use `pytest` to make sure everything works

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Ask your teacher or classmates**
- **Try the code and see what happens** - It's okay to make mistakes!
- **Read error messages carefully** - They often tell you what's wrong

## 💡 Tips for Success

- Save your work often (it auto-saves, but you can also press `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`)
- Run your code frequently to catch mistakes early
- Start small and build up - don't try to write everything at once
- If something doesn't work, try reading the error message - it usually gives you a hint!

## 🌐 Using This on Your Own Computer (Optional)

If you want to work on your own computer instead of Codespaces:

1. **Install Python** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scottluskraa/python-starter.git
   cd python-starter
   ```
3. **Install the required tools:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Start coding!**

But remember - using Codespaces is easier and requires no setup!
