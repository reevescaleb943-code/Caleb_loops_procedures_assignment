# What is a Function?
#   A PROCEDURE is a piece of code that you can easily use over and over. 
#   We will refer to this as a FUNCTION in this class
#   A function is a piece of code that has a name and completes a specific task.
#
# Creating Functions
#   We declare a function using the keyword def at the start
#   A function is invoked using parens () 
#   A function can accept parameters
#   A function can have a return value
#
# built in functions (these are like tools available to you)
#   print()
#   type()
#   len()
#   input()
#   range()
#   int(), str(), float(), bool(), list()
#   many more
#
# you can create your own functions
# you can comment functions to help organize and document what they do
# 
# Parts of a Function
#   Declare - def - give it a name and add the code to execute when it is called
#   Parameter (param1, param2) - values passed into a function
#   Return - return "foo" - also known as Output 
#   Call - my_method() - when you want to use the function
